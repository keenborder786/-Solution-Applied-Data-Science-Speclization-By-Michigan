# -Solution-Applied-Data-Science-Speclization-By-Michigan
"The 5 courses in this University of Michigan specialization introduce learners to data science through the python programming language. This skills-based specialization is intended for learners who have a basic python or programming background, and want to apply statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx to gain insight into their data.

Introduction to Data Science in Python (course 1), Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python (course 2), and Applied Machine Learning in Python (course 3) should be taken in order and prior to any other course in the specialization. After completing those, Applied Text Mining in Python (course 4) and Applied Social Network Analysis in Python (course 5) can be taken in any order."

This is my code which include solution for assignments of Applied Data Science Specilization by Michigan on coursera.

Assignments for each of the course are actual hands on data science projects which helped me to test my skills in real-like situation and some projects are actually subjective(course 2 projects) which require individual creative thinking.

Please refer to desired folder name for specific course solution. Moreover, I have included optional assignments and lecture code for better reference and guidance.
